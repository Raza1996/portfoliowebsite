            <h4>Type:</h4> <p>Individual Project</p>
            <h4>Tools:</h4> <p>Adobe Photoshop, Traditional Mediums</p>

          <div> 
            <p>This is a relatively old project where I translated a chapter of the book 'To Kill a Mocking Bird' into a short graphic novel. It gave me a good opportunity to stretch my creative muscles in representing the events of the chapter in a vastly different medium. The following is a breakdown of the project in chronological order.</p>
          </div>
          <div> 
            <h2>STORYBOARDING</h2>
            <p>The process for storyboarding graphic novels is much different from video projects. I had to think of panel layout and execution of events on paper. In addition, I also had to figure out what shot angle, and camera lens would be used on the fly. Many storyboards were reiterated repeatedly. The design was not a priority at this stage. This step was mostly focused on the rough idea of the product visualized. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="txtover">
            <img src="src/mockingbird/rough1.jpg" alt="Rough Sketch" >
            <figcaption>Figure.1: Storyboard 1</figcaption>
          </div>
          <div> 
            <p>I worked outside my comfort zone in these storyboards as I am much more accustomed to working with traditional six-panel storyboards. Throughout the rest of the process, I worked with the nagging feeling that I had to start from scratch if the storyboards weren't adequate. Luckily, that feeling was never justified with the end product.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="txtover">
            <img src="src/mockingbird/rough2.jpg" alt="Rough Sketch">
            <figcaption>Figure.2: Storyboard 2</figcaption>
          </div>
          <div> 
            <h2>CHARACTER DESIGN</h2>
            <p>Next was a matter of designing the characters for the graphic novel. I much enjoyed this process as it allowed me to try different types of looks before starting the main project.</p>
            <p>For example, in the case of this character, I went down a list of different hair types I think would suit her countenance for the story being told. In the end, I went for a long curly hair look to visually depict her childish appearance through more than just body type.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="txtover">
            <img src="src/mockingbird/char-design.jpg" alt="Character Design">
            <figcaption>Figure.3: Character Ideation for Scout Finch</figcaption>
          </div>
          <div> 
            <h2>FINAL PRODUCT</h2>
            <p>The Photoshop file in the creation of this piece was lost when my old hard drive was corrupted. However, the production process performed on it was straightforward. </p>
            <p>All I had to do was draw the panels with my graphic tablet and color the page in. I opted for a muted color palette as it effectively portrayed the era the events took place in which was depicted in the not so far off past. The final result looked like an early 70s television serial drama. I was pleasantly satisfied with the outcome.</p>

            <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
            <p>Sequential Art is a small passion of mine that I'm glad I got to fiddle with here. It really lets me flex my creative faculties. Adapting a well-regarded book made me ask how one relays the message of the original author in a vastly different medium. I also improved my ability to tell a story by picking from a sequence of events and asking what point of the event should be presented as well as how it should be presented.</p>
