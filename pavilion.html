            <p>After finishing a particularly ambitious project creating a procedurally generated pavilion in Holland Park, my team and I decided we wanted to exceed our professor's expectations by creating a video animation advertising the structure.</p>
            <p>This project was a hefty challenge as my team was fractured during its creation. I was vacationing in Toronto while my team mates were mostly busy during Christmas holidays. Nonetheless, our enthhusiasm for getting the project done never let distance become something worth complaining about. The final product exceeded my team's standards by quite a bit and the professor scored us generously for our troubles.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>PRODUCTION</h2>
            <p>My team mates sent me videos of shots containing the pavilion. Some shots were compromised due to improper compression during file transfer online. Unfortunately, we could not find a way to correct this without having a team mate fly over to my location on short notice. Still, some of the artifacting looked appealing in mirage sense so it was a good way to take advantage of our situation.</p>

          <div>
            <h2>EDITING</h2>
            <p>The video editing process for this assignment consisted of me improvising a narrative progression without a storyboard. I made use of a swipe animation which was featured heavily in the final video. I never used this kind of animation before, but it was a risk that really paid off at the end. It basically amounted to fiddling with layers to give the illusion that text disappeared with the swipe of a line.</p>
            <p>I tweaked away at the video in a separate room while there was a party going on the main room of my flat. A good laugh was had over my insistence on working on the video when I came back for the festivities.</p>

            <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
            <p>I made this project in a time crunch. My team had decided to tackle ithis undertaking last minute and even though we didn't need to finish it, I wanted to give it my best without any compromises in quality. I was proud of how I managed to make the video have artistic cohesion and narrative follow-through while basically improvising it from start to finish. The end product is crisp professional looking.</p>
